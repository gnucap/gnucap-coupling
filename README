=== from_file/v_file device implements file controlled voltage source

parameters:
 - filename. open that file.. default: device name
 - delay. replay stuff from file with a delay. default 0
 - iv. initial value. default 0.

notes:
 - should probably use SPLINES from bmm_table. and do some step control
 - a file can be a named pipe...
 - positive initial value avoids reading during initial step. see loop.1.gc

=== to_file device provides output written to a file

parameters:
 - filename. open that file to write to. default: device name

notes:
 - opening a fifo from the write end will wait for the other end.

EXAMPLES

see *.gc files. run with "gnucap file.gc"
